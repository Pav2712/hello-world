# hello-world
GitHub Learning 
Well I don't know much yet but I'm slowly learning how to write code for android.
I've been interested in this sort of thing since I was a kid but let it slip as 
the years went by with work and family but now I find a bit more time on 
my hands so ... here we go... diving into the big pool

I'm hoping one day to be able to create something and publish it for others 
to use.  A daunting thought but hey, you gotta try

any help welcome for this old newbie!
